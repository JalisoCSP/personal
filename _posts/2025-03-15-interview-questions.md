title: "Interview Questions"

At the end of May 2024, a recruiter contacted me for a job. For this particular job, the company wanted me to answer 5 questions alongside receiving my CV. Having to jump through these kinds of hoops (albeit sounding quite small), has always been a terrible experience for me.

_I never heard back from them._

Maybe my answers are lacking and can be improved. I'll be sharing each question separately, but I'm open to feedback. Roast me!
