I am a Rails Developer, currently working at Yozu in Liverpool. I have experience developing accounting software which is used by over 20,000 companies.

In my current role, I deal directly with the client to gather information on new feature requests, help narrow down the scope and implement these requests with a high standard of easily readable code. In addition to development, I help train and mentor new employees - getting them used to our office environment, our style of coding, but also developing my own communication skills. I'm always looking to learn and improve - helping new developers is proving to be one of the best ways to do this.

Alongside development, I've also lead a small team to produce an account management system for software that helps access detailed vehicle information. Our system is used to manage payments for the service as well as user permissions, invoicing and historical information.

In my own time, I work on several smaller projects and freelance work in order to help fulfil business needs and expand my own knowledge;

*   I've made many static websites.
*   I've self-managed and developed an ecommerce platform that has been very successful in its first year.
*   I'm developing skills in other areas, such as DevOps, Marketing and UI/UX Design.

I've recently found the sharing of my knowledge to be the best way to improve myself - so, I do this by writing and teaching.
