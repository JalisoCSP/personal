I work at Yozu Ltd in Liverpool, where I have worked since graduating
University 4 years ago.

I also manage my own development projects under [\_Calajo](https://calajo.co.uk),
where I am looking to expand on skills I don't get to use in my day job, such as
marketing, project management and Dev Ops.

I'm in the process of buying my first house with my partner, Nay, and hope to be
moving in very soon!

I'm spending a lot of time on self improvement this year. Since I'm a data
driven person, this involves a lot of data tracking, spreadsheets and habit
building. For the entirety of 2019, I'm tracking my habits daily, including side
project working hours, gaming time, health metrics, weight, syn count, exercise
and walking. I'm also trying to maintain beneficial habits by utilising streaks,
such as 200 Words A Day, Makerlog and Duo Lingo - did I mention I'm writing and
I'm learning French?
