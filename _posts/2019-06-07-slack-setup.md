My slack is set up in a very [clear, compact manner](https://twitter.com/JalisoCSP/status/1103943487492362241). I have nothing visible.

I'm in as few channels as possible and I never have the desire to hunt for messages. If for whatever reason I do - I can search for it. The S is Slack literally stands for Search.

[S.L.A.C.K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)) is Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge.

If my input is wanted, I'll get a direct message or an at (@) tag, which will give me a notification and an ping. I never need to hunt for a message.

My setup is designed to remove distraction.

**My preferences:**

*   I use the web app, so I don't have any application giving me desktop notifications.
*   I have DND set for out of hours. Always.
*   I turn off notications being sent to my mobile when I'm inactive.
*   Only show unread and starred conversations.

Whenever I get a message I want to remember or reply to I put a '//' in the chat. This way, I can't accidently send it, becasue '/' is a command and the channel (or more often the direct message) moves into my side bar. With the latest Slack update, this moves into a new category called 'Drafts'. Perfect.

Now, just to figure out how to get people to stop poking me on the shoulder.
