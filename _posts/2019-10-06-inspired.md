There are so many inspiring people around. I've stumbled upon a lot of people that inspire me all the time. Some that I'd never have thought.

I suppose you stumble upon and find the people you want to associate with. For me, I think the category of people I like to talk to and spend time with are the self improvers.

It would seem obvious that everyone wants to improve, but as I go through live, I'm not sure that's actually the case. Some people coast and some people stagnate themselves with excuses, self doubt and lack of self confidence. I know a few people where this comes to mind, but as you might be able to tell, I'm mostly talking about myself...

I want to work hard, improve and progress. This is what my streaks are about - for me, focusing on the streaks is a gateway to improving myself and the only thing holding me back is myself.

Previously, I've [talked about some of my excuses](https://200wordsaday.com/words/excuses-273165d7ffc8065bc4). It's a good start, but I need to combat them, stop with the excuses and improve. Maybe I just have too many things (oh shit, another excuse)...
