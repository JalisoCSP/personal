This is the title of another article I've wanted to write for a long time. I've mentioned in other entries about "Enough" with specific references to Paul Jarvis (@pjrvs on Twitter).

I've previously had arbitrary goals:

* a house by time I'm 30
* a salary of £30k per year by time I'm 30

Amongst others, by why were these significant? No reason in particular, they just seemed like good goals and nice round numbers... 30 by 30... sounds stupid typing it out.

The problem with these kind of goals are they are virtually meaningless. Sure, having an arbitrary number gives something a bit more simplistic to focus on. Earning 20k a year and want to achieve 30k a year? Work harder, get promoted, move job, ask for a raise - there are ways to achieve them, but they don't have any specific value. As with everything, there are other way to think of things - there can be more value mined from this, you can translate work hard to improve yourself, etc.

Without going into too much detail. I've hit these goals. I'm 29, I have a house and I'm on more than £30k a year.

I'm not fulfilled.

It's not enough.

The carrot is still dangling in front of me and I want more. We always want me. Where do we stop? What do I actually want and how do I achieve it?
