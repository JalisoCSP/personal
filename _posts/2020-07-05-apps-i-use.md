I've seen a couple of articles showing apps people use to run their businesses; [Pat Walls](https://patwalls.com/apps-services-that-i-pay-for), [Ian Grabill](https://www.iangrabill.com/apps-that-i-use-to-run-my-businesses/) and it was even suggested to check out the [Startup School Library](https://www.startupschool.org/library).

While I'm not running a business in the same sense, it got me thinking: what apps do I use regularly?

*   [Pandle](https://my.pandle.com/) for accounting - I was actually part of the team that built this until recently (AMA!)
*   Digital Ocean - server hosting
*   Google Analytics
*   Basecamp (Personal) - Keeping track of client work I do for reference, personal progress (weight, reading, studies)
*   Trello - I tend to save articles, podcasts, etc here to come back to. Also storing a list of ideas; projects to make, articles to write, etc.
*   Hey / Gmail
*   G Suite Business - not sure I need this now. Going to investigate.
*   Github
*   Twitter - I suppose it counts, right?
*   Stripe - payment processing
*   Mailgun - email delivery
*   Domain Monster - domain names

Other stuff I'm considering:

*   Toggl - time tracking. Just checking this out now.
*   Sentry - error reporting. I've used this before, very nice.
*   Upwork - Both the linked articles suggested they use it
*   Calendly - hoping to get in more facetime with actual people
