I'm a recovering geek, who is trying to improve myself and my life by build better habits in 2019. From my late teens to early adulthood, I was addicted to World of Warcraft. I've not played for many years now and the craving is completely dead. That style of game is still my favourite - that is, games where you can constantly improve, climb ranks and beat harder opponents.

My habit process started with tracking key attributes I wanted to improve, on a daily basis, including:

1.  My health
2.  My dental hygiene _(this makes me sound really disgusting, but I promise I wasn't that bad!)_
3.  My gaming/side project balance

Overall, I think I have improved in these areas this year, but as always there is much to learn and more to improve upon. During this process, I've developed other healthy habits, such as writing on 200WAD and learning a new language on Duolingo.

I've successfully completed 3 months of 25 mile Race At Your Pace challenges, and - due to an exceptional colleague - I'm in the middle of a 50 mile challenge where I have had to cement my Monday, Wednesday, Friday running habits. My running has processed a lot too, but I'm hoping to improve my times!

While I sometimes think I've gone too far into the extreme with my habits, I think my life is going rather well right now. I'm healthier than I've been for a long time, my worries are generally for "unimportant" things instead of essentials and I have a great home life.

It's been a long process, but I'm about to move into my first home with my long-term partner, Nay. We're moving to a house near a country park and will possibly be looking into foster a dog after we're settled.
