title: "Tell us about a time when you led the development of a product from concept to delivery. What were the key challenges, and how did you handle them?"
---

One project I led from concept to delivery was developing a vehicle search API platform. Our technical client had stringent security and performance requirements. I managed a small team while balancing another major project, which included myself, an ad-hoc designer, and a graduate developer I mentored into a more senior role.

This was my first time overseeing a full project that I wasn’t coding myself and it taught me valuable lessons in delegation, setting expectations and trusting the team to deliver. I also gained exposure to other areas of delivery that I wouldn't normally be involved in, including security, DevOps and UI/UX.

I’m proud of our team’s success, as we completed the project on time and met the strict security standards that our client set. Ultimately, the project generated over £50,000 per month, led to contract renewals and opened the door for additional projects with the client. The project was even used by the UK Police.

Since then, I've honed these skills on other projects, from small feature releases to entire new areas of our applications. For example, I took on a project with limited scope, co-ordinated with the co-founder and delivered a data visualisation project to determine how communities interact with each other and who are the most involved contributors. This work is what lead to our multi-million dollar deal.

This is the kind of depth and variety from over 10 years of development experience I would bring to [your company], allowing me to manage complex projects, align team efforts and deliver results that drive value for both the business and its clients.

### Self review

I realise when formating this for this post that I didn't really answer the question of "what are the key challenges, and how did you handle them?".
