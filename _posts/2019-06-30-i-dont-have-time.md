I keep planning to... well, plan. Something keeps getting in the way. I just don't have the time. Whenever I hear the sentence, "I don't have the time" I always recall an article I read that says;

> Instead of saying "I don't have time" try saying "it's not a priority" and see how that feels.

After a quick Google, I do recall the 2012 [lifehacker article](https://lifehacker.com/instead-of-saying-i-dont-have-time-say-its-not-a-pr-5892948) it came from, which is quoting Laura Vanderkam of Wall Street Journal.

It's been a life changing for me.

To start planning, I like to see what is currently holding me back. In a typical week;

*   Work Monday to Friday, 9 to 5.
*   Running 3 times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
*   Slimming World group on a Tuesday.
*   Granny's every Thursday, usually accompanied by my Dad.

I have a long term partner, who I try to spend a lot of time with, but sometimes it feels like this is preventing me from doing some things I really want to it, but then on the other hand; I love spending time with her (usually, ha!).

It's true that sometimes you need to spend time a part. It means we don't have to miss out on things, while having my _quality_ time together.

My free days are basically Monday, Wednesday and, usually, the weekends.

I need to plan times to work on my projects, play games and still enjoy time doing everything else. Monday and Wednesday seem like good places to start.
