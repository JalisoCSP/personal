My company required some code for an online booking system and I have been
working with Craig over the past year on this. He was patient with my layman
understanding of how it all works and ended up creating something that was
beyond my expectations. Aware of the importance of end user aesthetics as well
as functionality, our website booking page looks and works seamlessly. He was a
pleasure to work with and fully recommend his services.
